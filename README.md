Telecom-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-Model

Analyzing customer churn and predicting at-risk customers for a telecom company using Python and machine learning.

Project Overview

Churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. Retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we:

Explored customer data to understand patterns and behavior leading to churn.

Performed visual and statistical analysis to uncover key trends.

Built a logistic regression model to predict churn likelihood.

Identified at-risk customers based on their predicted probability.

🧠 What You’ll Find Inside
📁 Part 1 – Data Analysis (DSA in Python Part 1)
Data loading and cleaning

Understanding trends and distribution

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from features like tenure, monthly charges, contract types

📈 Part 2 – Prediction Modeling
Visualizations for churn trends and customer behavior

Trends over time (e.g., churn rate over tenure)

Logistic regression model to predict churn

Classification performance evaluation

Generated list of customers most at risk

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

✅ Outcomes
Churn rate: ~26.6% of customers had churned

Customers with shorter tenure and higher charges were more likely to churn

Model achieved ~79% accuracy

Identified a subset of high-risk customers for targeted retention efforts

📌 Why This Project?
This is one of the most complete end-to-end projects I've worked on—from raw data to actionable business insights. It's meant to showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning with a business-oriented mindset.

📂 How to Use
You can run the notebooks or scripts step by step to follow the analysis and modeling. The at-risk customers output can be exported or connected to a CRM system for follow-up actions.
